### Rendering Mollie credit card form

You can use `SyliusMolliePlugin:DirectDebit:_form.html.twig` and `@SyliusMolliePlugin/Grid/Action/cancelSubscriptionMollie.html.twig` templates for adding the form to supplementing the direct debit card data from and cancel the subscription form the Twig UI.

For an example on how to do that, take a look at [these source files](tests/Application/templates/bundles/SyliusShopBundle).

----
##### You can [decorate](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/service_decoration.html) available services and [extend](https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/create_form_type_extension.html) current forms.

Run the below command to see what Symfony services are shared with this plugin:

```
$ bin/console debug:container sylius_mollie_plugin
```

```
$ composer install
$ cd tests/Application

```

in: src/Resources/views/Shop/_javascripts.html.twig:
<script src="https://js.mollie.com/v1/mollie.js"></script>
{{ encore_entry_script_tags('shop-entry', null, 'mollie-shop') }}
